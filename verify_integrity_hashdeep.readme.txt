Variable Setup:
The script defines paths for the source directory, destination directory, log file, and a temporary manifest file.

Logging Function:
A log function prefixes messages with a timestamp and writes them to the log file.

Manifest Generation:
The command

hashdeep -r "$SOURCE" > "$MANIFEST"

recursively scans the source directory and writes a manifest file containing the hash for each file.

Counting Files:
The script counts the number of lines (i.e. files) in the manifest so that it can calculate an approximate progress percentage during verification.

Verification:
The command

hashdeep -r -a -k "$MANIFEST" "$DEST"

recursively verifies the destination directory against the manifest. The -a option tells hashdeep to audit files against the manifest, and -k specifies the manifest file.
As hashdeep produces output, the script reads each line, increments a counter, calculates the percentage complete, and logs the line along with the progress.

Completion:
When verification is complete, a final message is logged.

This script offers a practical way to verify large amounts of data using hashdeep with realâ€‘time logging and an approximate progress indicator.
