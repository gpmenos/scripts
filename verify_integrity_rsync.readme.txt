Variable Setup:
The script defines three variables:

    SOURCE — the path to the source directory
    DEST — the path to the destination directory
    LOGFILE — the file to which all log messages (including progress info) will be appended

Logging Function:
The log function prefixes messages with a timestamp.

Total Size Calculation:
The script uses du -sb to calculate the total byte size of the source. This value is logged for reference.

rsync Command:
The command used is:

rsync -rcn --info=progress2 "${SOURCE}/" "${DEST}/"

    -r tells rsync to operate recursively.
    -c forces rsync to compare files using a checksum rather than mod-time/size.
    -n is the dry-run flag so that no files are actually transferred.
    --info=progress2 provides an overall progress indicator.

Progress Parsing:
As rsync outputs progress information, the script’s while loop writes each line to the log and uses a regex to capture a percentage value if present. (Because rsync’s progress formatting can vary, the regex may need adjustment depending on your version and locale.)

Logging Completion:
When rsync finishes, the script logs a final completion message.
